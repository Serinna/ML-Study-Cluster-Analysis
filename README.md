In this project, I first used LDA to analyze tree types with the variables given. By result, LD1 explained 94.27% of the variance, and the misclassification rate is about 0.3. 
By MANOVA, all variables contribute to prediciting the tree types.
By Barplot of group of means of each variable, elevation has the largest variation among group means (most important factor). Using only elevation to predict only increase the error for 0.03.

I also applied K means clustering to see how many true types there are. From the resulting line plot of within-group sum of squares, k=6 should be used since there's no significant drop of sum of squares. 
By visualization of the clustering result, four types are separated significantly, but the other two groups seem to be merged together, indicating there's no significance difference between them.
